# Reach
The ultimate html preprocessor. Provide Reach with your HTML templates, and let it compile them into reactive web components.

## Moto
1. Put that ðŸ’© in you're markup.
2. Stay language agnostic.
3. Keep the DX dead-simple.

Reach is all about banking on *the future*. With the rising adoption of view transitions, developers will be able to lean more on the server without sacraficing UX.

Write the HTML templates and let reach generate your web components.

Dead simple.
